# Paas Profiles

*Making PaaS offerings comparable - Ecosystem profiles for PaaS vendors.*

Currently 82 PaaS vendor profiles. Profiles are encoded as [JSON files](/profiles/).

For convenience, the profiles can be viewed via executing the [sinatra app](sinatra_profiles.rb).

**The current web interface can be viewed [online](http://paas-profiles.aws.af.cm/vendors).**

`horizontal` = Can you scale the number of instances?  
`auto` = Is the PaaS capable of scaling any of the above properties automatically?    

### Hosting

An array that describes the different provided hosting styles of the PaaS.

    { "language": "ruby", "versions": [ "1.9.3", "2.0.0" ] }
]
```

#### Language

This section must only include languages that are officially supported by the vendors.

    { "name": "tomcat", "versions": [ "6", "7" ] },
    { "name": "glassfish", "versions": [ "3.1" ] }
]
```

#### Name

Should be the official name in lowercase. Currently not restricted.

#### Versions

A string array containing the supported middleware versions.

### Frameworks

*tbd*

### Services

```json
"services": {
  "native": [
    { "name": "mongodb", type="", "description": "", "versions": [ "1.8" ] } // tbd
  ],
  "addon": [
    { "name": "mongolab", url="https://mongolab.com/", description="", type="" } // tbd
  ]
}
```

#### Native

#### Addon

#### Type

A category the service does fit in. Currently allowed keys are:
*tbd* Maybe make it an array of types. 

```
datastore, search, worker, analytics, payment, media, messaging, other, devops
```

### Infrastructures

The infrastructures an application can be deployed to. Defined as an array of objects.

```json
"infrastructures": [
    { 
      "continent": "EU",
      "country": "IE",
      "region": "Dublin",
      "provider": "AWS"
    }
]
```

#### Continent

The continent must be encoded with the following continent codes:

AF = Africa, AS = Asia, EU = Europe, NA = North America, OC = Oceania, SA = South America
```

#### Country

The country codes must conform to the country codes defined in [ISO 3166-2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2).
